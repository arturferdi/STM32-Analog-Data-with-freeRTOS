# STM32-Analog-Data-with-freeRTOS
Here I created a program using STM32Cube IDE Framework to read analog data and combine it with freeRTOS. For this, I use STM32F103 Series, or commonly it is called "Blue Pill". Well, we all know that STM32 GPIO's are around 3.3V tolerant. And only use single channel ADC.
